# Data Visualisation and Analytics

## Overview

This course covers the principles and algorithms of data analytics and visualization, including data collection (e.g., web scraping, APIs), processing (wrangling, reduction, aggregation), analysis, and visualization techniques (design, interaction, algorithms). 
It also addresses specific data types like time series, text, and spatial data, with practical Python exercises and visualization tools.


## Assignment 1: Command Line


## [Assignment 2: Using an API and Visualising Your Data](2_Using_API_and_Visualising_Data.ipynb)

The task involves formulating two analysis questions based on the data chosen, extracting the relevant data from the API, and creating two visualizations using the Python library Altair to answer the questions.

## [Assignment 3: Explorative Network Analysis](3_Explorative_Network_Analysis.ipynb)

This task involves select a network dataset of your choice, and perform an exploratory data analysis, including identifying central nodes by calculating centrality measures. 
The network is to be visualised using at least two visual encodings (e.g., color, size of edges/nodes), label nodes or use tooltips, and apply an appropriate graph layout.
